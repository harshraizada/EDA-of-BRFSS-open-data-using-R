# BRFSS Healthcare Data Analytics using R

## Brief Summary on the Topic:

Because of my past education and working experience in Healthcare I have selected The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) open data set, which is the United states premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect data about U.S. residents (18 year or older) regarding their health-related risk behaviours, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.
What is risk factor surveillance?
Keeping track of the rates of risk factors which are the things or states in our daily lives that confers risk to our health is defined as a Risk Factor Surveillance.
By collecting behavioural health risk data at the federal and state level, BRFSS has become a powerful tool for targeting and designing health promotion activities for the US population.


## Description of analysis procedure and objectives:

 I have tried to done Descriptive analytics which usually aims at developing population based rates (or percentage) with this data set.
Originally BRFSS data set were having sample of 486303 US residents (observations) and 275 variables in the data set but then I have removed unnecessary columns from the data by sub setting the data set after which I have left with 421192 observation with 13 variables (which were required for my  analysis). Data is pretty cleaned so only one variable (General Health) needed data cleaning for the analysis.

Objective-1 To find out the perception of the people about their existing general health status among US residents. 

Objective-2 To find out the existing health care coverage rate among US residents.

Objective-3 To find out the existing exercise or physical activity rates among US residents.

Objective-4 To find out the existing smoking rate of respondents who have ever smoked in their life.

Objective-5 To find out the current smoking status of the respondent who ever smoked in their life. 

Objective -6 To find out the existing coverage rate of flu vaccine among US residents.

Objective-7 To find out the existing seat belt usage practices (or rate) among US residents.
